# README

I led the forefront of the development team as a project manager working alongside other PMs and back-end engineers for Project Bracket, a CS club at Diablo Valley College. Our developed program, StockProphit demonstrates Polygon's Stocks API retrieval to display graphical output of a company's predicted stock prices in 1 year. A linear regression model is trained using a data set given by user-input to make a "plausible" prediction for future stock prices. These results may not be 100% accurate as the program was intended to serve as a learning opportunity for API retrieval with stocks and machine learning algorithms.


The development timeline of this project was during the 2023 Spring semester for Project Bracket (March - May).
